This project aims at providing an actor system for Scala.js, featuring:

*   Supervision
*   (Almost) transparent collaboration with actors in an Akka-based backend
*   Transparent collaboration with actors in several Web Workers

It is currently a prototype, working well but still in a rough shape. Hence,
it is not published anywhere yet.
